## Download
[Click here to download the game.](downloads/Zahhak.zip?raw=true)

It runs on Windows, OS X, and Linux

**OBS!** One must have the .NET Framework or Mono installed.

## Purpose
To create a simple game for beginners to learn the C# programming language. I tried to use the full capabilities of C# 6.0 and make the code as easy to understand as possible, therefore it may seem that it should be optimized more.

I do hope that teachers use the code as a learning exercise for students.

## Development
This was written in C# 6.0 with Visual Studio 2015. One must also  **install Rx-Main using NuGet**, in order to compile the program.
